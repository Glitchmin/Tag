                it's label is label
                it is connected to vertex with index lhs_index in LHS graph
            Let considered_vertices be set of vertices that contains vertices which are connected to lhs_index with matching edges

            Then insert new edges in place of found edges
            Each new edge is described with 4 params:
                it's label is new_edge_label
                it's direction is is_outgoing (in reference to RHS)
                it's ends are:
                    RHS_vertex_index
                    All vertices in rest of graph which met conditions:
                        have label Rest_of_graph_vertex_label
